# Investigate_a_Dataset_Project_ALX-T_Udacity


## Introduction


### Dataset Description 

> **Project Overview**:
In this project, I will analyze the dataset of [**No-show appointments**], and then communicate my findings about it. This dataset collects information from more than 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

> Such dataset is part of the ALX-T Data Analyst Nano Degree (DAND) track from Udacity online learning platform [URL](https://www.alxafrica.com/programme_post/data-analyst/).
